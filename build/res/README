Sealion is a Linux system monitoring/debugging solution. This is the agent to collect data.


Software requirements
=====================
#   Requires GNU Linux kernel version 2.6 or above.
#   Requires Python version 2.6 or above. 
    If you have multiple versions of python installed, use -p option in the installer to point to the preferred version.
#   Requires SSL and SQLite3 modules in Python.


Usage
=====
#   If installed as a service, execute 
    service sealion start|stop|restart|status

#   If not installed as a service, execute
    etc/init.d/sealion start|stop|restart|status

Note:   You might want to add 'etc/init.d/sealion start' to your system startup scripts if not installed as a service. 
        This will allow agent to run automatically on system startup.


Configuration
=============
Warning: Do not edit 'etc/agent.json'. This file contains private settings for agent. 

'etc/config.json' contains configurable settings for agent. Refer 'etc/config.json.example' for details.

Note: To make SeaLion Agent work behind a proxy, add {"https_proxy": "your proxy address"} to 'env' key in 'etc/config.json'.
      For any changes to take effect, Sealion Agent must be restarted.


Logging
=======
#   'var/log/sealion.log' contains log of SeaLion Agent. You may configure logging. 
    Refer 'etc/config.json.example' for details.
#   'var/log/update.log' contains update logs.


Misc
====
If you have custom scripts to run via SeaLion, you can keep them under opt/custom. 
The content of this directory remains intact during agent update.


Uninstall
=========
To uninstall agent, execute uninstall.sh

Note: Uninstalling agent requires super privilege.
